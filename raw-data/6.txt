A sandy desert lit by a dull red sun. There are extensive fossilized forests. Some local plants hover in mid-air, held aloft by gas bags.

The animals of Torlm V avail themselves of poisonous darts used both for defense and hunting. They only live for a day.

There are regular formations of plants that look like abandoned fields.
