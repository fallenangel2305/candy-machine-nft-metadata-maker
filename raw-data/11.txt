Ulegig IV

A supercontinent and some small, shallow seas mostly covered with ice. A network of tunnels extends under much of the surface. There are groups of tall, crimson stalks everywhere.

Mobile stacks of feathered hexagons slowly move around. The local life is enmeshed in a complex symbiotic network.

There are rumours of a monastery of heretical monks.
